# EmailSlicer1
Email Slicer is just a simple tool that will take an email address as an input and slice it to produce the username and the domain associated with it. The email must be divided into two strings by using 'at the rate' as the separator.

Example
Input GeeksforGeeks@gmail.com
Output Your username is GeeksforGeeks and domain is gmail.com
